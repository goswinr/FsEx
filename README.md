# FsEx
another FSharp extension and utility library. 

I use it often when writing scripts.

#### It Includes 
- useful extension members to existing collections like seq, array, dictionary.
- A module for functions on ResizeArry similar to the FSharp.Core ones on array
- An implementation of a [defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict), a very usefull collection in Python
- Computaional Expressions vor building strings and ResizeArrays like they exist for seq, list and array in FSharp.Core 
- pretty printing for collections
- and more ..
